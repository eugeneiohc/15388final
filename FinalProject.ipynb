    "# Introduction\n",
    "What's the last school shooting you remember? If you're on top of your news, then you'll know it was the Oshkosh, Washington shooting, about a week ago (from the time this was written). \n",
    "Do you remember the details, though?\n",
    "Probably not.\n",
    "\n",
    "What about the shooting the day right before Oshkosh? Or the four in November?\n",
    "The problem is clear: school shootings are a regular occurrence and it's hard to keep track of them all, let alone the details of each one.\n",
    "In fact, according to Wikipedia, there were 64 US school shootings from 2000-2009, 87 from 2010-2014, and 113 from 2015-November 2019. \n",
    "If these numbers seem lower than you expected, remember that these are ONLY school shootings, not mass shootings. The numbers there are staggering: 2,138 since 2013, roughly one a day. The number changes a bit depending on how you define a mass shooting, but either way the point remains: the number of shootings that occur in the U.S. is unacceptably high.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why are we doing analysis on this topic?\n",
    "Our group recognizes that school shootings are an extremely sensitive topic, and we don't want anyone or any of their friends to ever go through an event like this. We want to research this topic and first find out if any specific shootings are getting more coverage than others because they should all have the same amount coverage from an ethical standpoint. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this project we want to focus on school shootings, as the definition of school shooting is much more clearly defined and can be analyzed easier with a smaller timeframe. Our goal is to find causes of the spike in shootings, especially in the past decade. From this coverage, we also want to determine if there are factors of the shooting that increased the chance of the shooting to occur. This does not mean that we are simply writing off other mass shootings that do not occur in schools, but we are trying to cover a topic that is still relevant to all of our lives.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that none of us want to push any sort of policy or idea or agenda here: we want to stay as neutral as possible. The dataset that we are working with is relatively small so we will be careful in making certain assumptions.\n",

    "## Beginning our Analysis\n",
    "Our goal is to figure out significant school shootings by getting compiled data from Wikipedia and recording certain characteristics about that specific event. With those characteristics, we want to scrape various data sources, such as Fox News, CNN, etc, and see if characteristics of the shooting affect the amount that it is reported among various source.\n",
    "We recognize that because we have a very small dataset that we may not be able to come up with any significant conclusions, but we believe that it is a start to making steps towards doing so in identifying these reporting patterns."
